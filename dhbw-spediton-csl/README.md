Zotero doesn't natively support the concept of multiple bibliographies within a single document. However, there's a workaround you can use. You can create separate Zotero collections for different types of sources and then generate bibliographies from these collections individually.

Here's how you can do it:

### Creating Zotero Collections:

1. **Create Collections:**
   In Zotero, create two collections: one for "Literaturverzeichnis" and another for "Literaturverzeichnis sonstiger Quellen".

2. **Organize Items:**
   Add the relevant sources to the appropriate collections. Add books, articles, theses, etc., to "Literaturverzeichnis" and websites, hearings, and other sources to "Literaturverzeichnis sonstiger Quellen".

### Generating Bibliographies:

1. **Generate Bibliographies:**
   While writing your document, use the "Cite" button in Zotero to add citations. When you're ready to generate the bibliography, go to the end of your document.

2. **Insert Bibliography:**
   For "Literaturverzeichnis" section, go to Zotero, right-click on the "Literaturverzeichnis" collection, and select "Create Bibliography from Collection". Choose your citation style and copy the generated bibliography into your document.

   For "Literaturverzeichnis sonstiger Quellen", follow the same steps for the respective collection.

This way, you can have two separate bibliographies in your document, one for regular sources and another for websites, hearings, and other miscellaneous sources. While it's not a perfect solution, it allows you to achieve the desired separation of sources in your document. Remember to manually adjust headings like "Literaturverzeichnis" and "Literaturverzeichnis sonstiger Quellen" in your document as Zotero won't handle these headings automatically.
